Overall Time used for assignment 6-7 hours.

1. Frontend Task - 2 hours
This task was pretty straight straight forward to work with. 
I had to first read through the code base to see how data was being displayed.
Then I had to look throught the Chart.js documentation to figure out which functions/edits I needed to do.

2. Backend Task - 4-5 hours
This took me a little longer to work with as I've rarely seen Google Firebase prior to this.
Most of my time was spent researching cloud functions and how they work.
Firestore was very similar to MongoDB so that didn't take too long to understand. 
Finially test cases took around 30 minutes to 1 hour to ensure everything worked.
